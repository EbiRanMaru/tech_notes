abstract = {We report development of a high dynamic range spectroscopic system comprising a spectrometer with 30{\%} throughput and a camera with a low-noise fast-readout complementary metal-oxide semiconductor sensor. The system achieves a 106 dynamic range (?20 bit resolution) and an instrumental function approximated by a Voigt profile with Gauss and Lorentz widths of 31 and 0.31 pm, respectively, for 656 nm light. The application of the system for line profile observations of the Balmer-? emissions from high temperature plasmas generated in the Large Helical Device is also presented. In the observed line profiles, emissions are detected in far wings more than 1.0 nm away from the line center, equivalent to neutral hydrogen atom kinetic energies above 1 keV. We evaluate atom density distributions in the core plasma by analyzing the line profiles. ? 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},
